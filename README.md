# DSCI 510 Final Project
## Predicting Chronic Diseases from Personal Wearable Devices
***
### About
This repository contains the code for Danielle Louie's final project for DSCI 510 at the University of Southern California. The project aims to identify whether health indicators from personal wearable devices, specifically Apple Watches and Fitbits can help to predict potential chronic diseases. 

### Current Progress
Currently, the repository contains the script `load.py` which is responsible for collecting data provided in two forms: csv files and an API. The second script, `tests.py`, currently contains a test to ensure that the data collected by an API is not empty. More explanations about the sources, scripts, and functions are under the `doc` folder in a PDF file.
